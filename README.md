# PMRM
 This repo is for a Perpetual Marble Run Machine I am making for my Game Development Pipeline assignment
 
 #Build
 I haven't adjusted any of the build settings as I didn't need to in order to complete my assignment but if you find better build settings then the default then please let me know by opening an issue
 
 #Controlls
 All the controls are customiseable from the configuration screen when running the .exe however I will list what controls are used and their default keybindings
 
 Camera Look Up/Down = Mouse Y
 Camera Look Left/Right = Mouse X
 Camera Forwards = W
 Camera Backwards = S
 Camera Left = A
 Camera Right = D
 Camera Up = Space
 Camera Down = Left Shift
 Hide/Show Mouse = J
 
 You will need to show the mouse in order to use the HUD buttons. While the mouse is shown, the camera position will not update till the mouse is hidden again
